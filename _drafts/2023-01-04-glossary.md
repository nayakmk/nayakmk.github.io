## Database

### Shared Lock



### Exclusive Lock



### Read Your Own Write

## Phenomena

### Dirty Read

### Non Repeatable Read

### Phantom Read

### Dirty Write

### Read Skew

### Write Skew

### Lost Update

## Caching

### Cache Aside

In this strategy, the cache is sitting aside the database. The application will first request the data from the cache. If the data exists (we call this a ‘cache hit’), the app will retrieve the data directly. If not (we call this a ‘cache miss’), the app will request data from the database and write it to the cache so that the data can be retrieved from the cache again next time.

### Read Through

Unlike cache aside, the cache sits in between the application and the database. The application only request data from the cache. If a ‘cache miss’ occurs, the cache is responsible to retrieve data from the database, update itself and return data to the application.

### Write Through

Similar to read through, the cache sits in between. Every writes from the application must go through the cache to the database.

### Write Ahead/Refresh Ahead

We can compare this approach to preparing dataset in the background and uploading it into cache. Obviously, not everything may fit into cache. This type of cache is useful for high number of read requests. The downside is that it requires some efforts to implement it properly, especially if we are going to implement TTL on the particular entry (instead of whole cache). 



### Write Behind/Write Back

It has a similar setup with write through. The application still writes data to the cache. However, there is a delay in writing from the cache to the database. The cache only flushes all updated data to the DB once in a while (e.g. every 2 minutes).

### Write Around

Write around usually combines with either cache aside or read through strategy. The application writes directly to the database. Only data that is read goes to the cache.

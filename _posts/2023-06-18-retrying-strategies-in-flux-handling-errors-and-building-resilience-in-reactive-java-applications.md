## Introduction

In Reactive Java, Flux is a powerful component for working with streams of data. When dealing with potentially failing operations, it's important to implement retry strategies to handle errors and build resilience into your applications. Flux provides several operators that allow you to implement different retry scenarios and backoff strategies.

In this post, we will explore different retry scenarios using operators like `retry`, `retryWhen`, `backOff`, and `repeat` in Flux. We will also provide examples to demonstrate their usage.

## Retry Operator

The `retry` operator in Flux allows you to automatically retry a sequence of operations in case of failures. It takes an optional parameter specifying the maximum number of retry attempts. When an error occurs, the operator will resubscribe to the source Flux and retry the operation. If the maximum number of attempts is reached and the error still persists, the error will be propagated to the subscriber.

Here's an example of using the `retry` operator in Flux:

```java
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

public class FluxRetryExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Flux<Integer> flux = Flux.range(1, 5)
                .map(i -> {
                    if (i == 3) {
                        throw new RuntimeException("Error occurred");
                    }
                    return i;
                })
                .retry(2);

        flux.subscribe(
                System.out::println,
                error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error.getMessage())
        );
    }
}
```

In this example, the `retry` operator is used to retry the failed operation up to 2 times. When the value `3` is encountered, a `RuntimeException` is thrown. The `retry` operator will resubscribe to the source Flux and retry the operation twice. If the error persists after the maximum number of retries, the error will be propagated to the subscriber.

```

## RetryWhen Operator

The `retryWhen` operator provides more flexibility by allowing you to define a custom retry logic based on a reactive signal. It takes a `Function` that receives a `Flux` of error signals and returns a `Publisher` that emits a signal to retry or terminate the operation.

Here's an example of using the `retryWhen` operator in Flux:

```java
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;
import reactor.util.retry.Retry;

import java.time.Duration;

public class FluxRetryWhenExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

      Flux<Integer> flux = Flux.range(1, 5)
        .map(i -> {
            if (i == 3) {
                throw new RuntimeException("Error occurred");
            }
            return i;
        })
        .retryWhen(Retry.fixedDelay(3, Duration.ofSeconds(1)));

        flux.subscribe(
                System.out::println,
                error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error.getMessage())
        );

    }
}
```

In this example, the `retryWhen` operator is used to define a delay logic. It retries the failed operation three times with a delay of 1 second between each retry. If the error still persists after three retries, the error is propagated to the subscriber.

Error: Retries exhausted: 3/3
```

## Repeat Operator

The `repeat` operator in Flux allows you to repeat the sequence of operations a specified number of times. It is useful when you want to re-execute a Flux multiple times, regardless of success or failure.

Here's an example of using the `repeat` operator in Flux:

```java
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

public class FluxRepeatExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Flux<Integer> flux = Flux.range(1, 3)
                .repeat(2);

        flux.subscribe(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `repeat` operator is used to repeat the sequence of numbers `1, 2, 3` two times. 

```

```

## Conclusion

In this post, we explored different retry scenarios and operators in Flux. The `retry`, `retryWhen` and `repeat` operators provide powerful capabilities to handle errors, implement retry strategies, and build resilient reactive Java applications. By understanding these operators and their use cases, you can effectively handle errors, recover from failures, and ensure the reliability of your data processing pipelines.

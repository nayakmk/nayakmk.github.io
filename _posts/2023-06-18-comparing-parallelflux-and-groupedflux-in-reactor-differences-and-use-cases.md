## Introduction

Reactor is a popular library for reactive programming in Java, providing a wide range of operators and utilities for processing streams of data. Two key features in Reactor for handling concurrent operations are `ParallelFlux` and `GroupedFlux`. In this post, we will compare these two types and discuss their differences, advantages, and use cases.

|        | ParallelFlux                                           | GroupedFlux                                    |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose| Enables parallel execution of tasks in a reactive stream | Groups items in a reactive stream by a specific key |
| Syntax | `Flux<T>.parallel()`                                    | `Flux<T>.groupBy(keyExtractor)`                 |
| Concurrency | Executes tasks in parallel using multiple threads     | Processes items sequentially in the same thread |
| Use Cases | CPU-bound tasks, network requests, I/O operations     | Grouping data by a common attribute or key      |

## ParallelFlux

`ParallelFlux` allows for parallel processing of tasks by splitting the workload across multiple threads. It provides concurrency by internally utilizing a `Scheduler` and parallelism by applying parallel operators on the stream. This is beneficial for CPU-bound tasks, network requests, or I/O operations that can be executed concurrently.

Example usage:

```java
ParallelFlux<Integer> parallelFlux = Flux.range(1, 10)
        .parallel()
        .runOn(Schedulers.parallel())
        .map(i -> i * 2)
        .doOnNext(System.out::println)
        .sequential();

parallelFlux.subscribe();
```

Advantages of ParallelFlux:
- Improved performance for CPU-bound tasks through parallel execution.
- Efficient utilization of available computing resources by utilizing multiple threads.

## GroupedFlux

`GroupedFlux` is used for grouping items in a reactive stream by a specific key. It allows you to process items sequentially within each group. The key is extracted using a key extractor function provided to the `groupBy()` operator. This is useful when you want to group data by a common attribute or key, such as grouping sales transactions by product category.

Example usage:

```java
Flux<Transaction> transactions = ...; // Stream of transaction objects
Flux<GroupedFlux<String, Transaction>> groupedFlux = transactions
        .groupBy(Transaction::getCategory);

groupedFlux.subscribe(group -> {
    String category = group.key();
    group.subscribe(transaction -> {
        // Process transactions of each group
        System.out.println("Category: " + category + ", Transaction: " + transaction);
    });
});
```

Advantages of GroupedFlux:
- Simplifies data grouping and processing by providing a convenient API for working with grouped items.
- Enables efficient processing of grouped data without the need for explicit parallelism.

## Conclusion

In this post, we compared `ParallelFlux` and `GroupedFlux` in Reactor. We discussed their differences, advantages, and use cases. `ParallelFlux` is suitable for parallel execution of tasks in a reactive stream, especially for CPU-bound or concurrent operations. On the other hand, `GroupedFlux` is designed for grouping items by a specific key, making it useful for data aggregation and analysis.

By understanding the characteristics and use cases of `ParallelFlux` and `GroupedFlux`, you can leverage the power of Reactor to handle concurrency and data grouping effectively in your Java applications. Experiment with these features and choose the appropriate type based on your application's requirements.

Remember to consider factors like the nature of your tasks, performance considerations, and the desired level of concurrency or grouping when selecting the appropriate approach for your use case.

Both OIDC (OpenID Connect) and SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) are widely used authentication protocols that enable secure identity verification and single sign-on (SSO) capabilities. While they serve similar purposes, there are notable differences between the two. In this post, we will compare OIDC and SAML, exploring how they work and their key features.

## OIDC (OpenID Connect)

OIDC is an authentication protocol built on top of OAuth 2.0. It provides a framework for verifying the identity of end-users based on the authentication performed by an OIDC provider. OIDC offers several advantages:

- Simplicity: OIDC is relatively simple to implement and provides a standardized way to authenticate users.

- Modern Web and Mobile Support: OIDC is designed with modern web and mobile applications in mind, offering better support for these platforms.

- User Information: OIDC provides user information through ID tokens, making it easier to personalize user experiences or fetch additional user details.

- Widely Adopted: OIDC is widely adopted and supported by various identity providers and software libraries.

## SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)

SAML is an XML-based authentication and authorization protocol. It enables secure SSO across different domains or systems. Some key features of SAML include:

- Extensibility: SAML supports custom extensions, allowing organizations to define their own authentication and authorization mechanisms.

- Strong Security: SAML provides strong security measures, including message signing and encryption.

- Cross-Domain SSO: SAML enables SSO across different domains, making it suitable for scenarios involving multiple applications or organizations.

- Legacy Support: SAML has been around for a longer time and is widely adopted in enterprise environments, making it suitable for integrating with legacy systems.

## How OIDC and SAML Work

OIDC and SAML follow different approaches for authentication:

1. OIDC: In OIDC, the client application redirects the user to the OIDC provider's authentication endpoint. The user enters their credentials, and upon successful authentication, the OIDC provider issues an ID token and an access token. The client can then use the ID token to verify the user's identity and the access token to access protected resources.

2. SAML: In SAML, the client redirects the user to the identity provider (IdP) for authentication. The IdP authenticates the user and generates a SAML assertion containing the user's identity information. The assertion is then sent back to the client, which can use it to access resources or applications within the service provider's (SP) domain.

## OIDC vs SAML: Choosing the Right Protocol

When deciding between OIDC and SAML, consider the following factors:

- Application Requirements: OIDC is better suited for modern web and mobile applications, while SAML is more commonly used in enterprise environments and with legacy systems.

- Ecosystem and Support: OIDC has gained significant popularity and has a larger ecosystem of identity providers and software libraries. SAML, on the other hand, is widely adopted in enterprise settings.

- Integration Needs: Consider the existing systems and applications you need to integrate with. Some systems may have better support for one protocol over the other.

In summary, OIDC and SAML are both powerful authentication protocols, each with its own strengths and best use cases. Understanding the differences and choosing the right protocol depends on your specific requirements and the context of your application.

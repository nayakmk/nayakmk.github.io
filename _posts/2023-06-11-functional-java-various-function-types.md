## Various Types of Functions

Functional Java provides various types of functions that support functional programming. These function types are defined as functional interfaces in the Java standard library. Here are some common types of functions in functional Java:

1. `Function<T, R>`: This functional interface represents a function that takes **an argument of type** `T` and **returns a result of type** `R`. It is used to transform an input value into an output value. The `apply` method is defined in this interface to perform the computation.
2. `Predicate<T>`: The `Predicate` functional interface represents a function that takes an argument of type `T` and returns a **boolean** value. It is commonly used for filtering elements or checking a condition. The `test` method is defined in this interface to evaluate the predicate.
3. `Consumer<T>`: The `Consumer` functional interface represents a function that takes an argument of type `T` and performs some action but **does not return any result**. It is often used for side-effecting operations like printing or modifying objects. The `accept` method is defined in this interface to consume the value.
4. `Supplier<T>`: The `Supplier` functional interface represents a function that **does not take any arguments** but **produces a result** of type `T`. It is used to provide values on demand. The `get` method is defined in this interface to retrieve the value.
5. `BiFunction<T, U, R>`: This functional interface represents a function that **takes two arguments** of types `T` and `U` and returns a result of type `R`. It is used for operations that involve two inputs and produce an output. The `apply` method is defined in this interface to perform the computation.
6. `UnaryOperator<T>`: The `UnaryOperator` functional interface represents a function that **takes an argument of type** `T` and **returns a** **result of the same type** `T`. It is used for functions that perform transformations on a single input. The `apply` method is defined in this interface to perform the computation.
7. `BinaryOperator<T>`: The `BinaryOperator` functional interface represents a function that **takes two arguments** of type `T` and returns a **result of the same type** `T`. It is used for functions that operate on two inputs and produce a result. The `apply` method is defined in this interface to perform the computation.

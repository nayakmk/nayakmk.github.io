In this blog post, we will explore various pagination approaches for designing Java REST APIs. Pagination is essential when dealing with large datasets to improve performance and reduce the load on the server. We'll present the different pagination approaches in a tabular format for easy comparison and understanding.

## Pagination Approaches

| Approach | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Offset-Based Pagination | Use query parameters to specify the number of records to skip and the number of records to fetch in each request. | `/api/users?offset=20&limit=10` |
| Page-Based Pagination | Use query parameters to specify the page number and the number of records to fetch per page. | `/api/users?page=2&size=10` |
| Cursor-Based Pagination | Use a cursor or token to mark the last fetched record and fetch the next set of records after that cursor. | `/api/users?cursor=eyJpZCI6MX0` |
| Keyset Pagination | Use query parameters to specify the last fetched record's unique key and fetch the next set of records based on that key. | `/api/users?lastKey=12345` |

## Examples

### Offset-Based Pagination

```
GET /api/users?offset=20&limit=10
```

### Page-Based Pagination

```
GET /api/users?page=2&size=10
```

### Cursor-Based Pagination

```
GET /api/users?cursor=eyJpZCI6MX0
```

### Keyset Pagination

```
GET /api/users?lastKey=12345
```

## Conclusion

Choosing the right pagination approach is crucial to efficiently retrieve and display data in a Java REST API. Offset-based pagination is simple but may suffer from performance issues for deep pagination. Page-based pagination is easy to implement but may not be suitable for real-time data. Cursor-based and keyset pagination offer more efficient solutions for handling large datasets. Consider the nature of your data and application requirements to select the most appropriate pagination approach.

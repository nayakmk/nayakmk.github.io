Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security mechanism implemented by web browsers to enforce restrictions on cross-origin requests. In a client-server application, CORS is handled both on the client-side and the server-side to ensure secure communication between different origins. In this post, we will explore what CORS is, where it is handled, and explain the various headers involved along with examples.

## What is CORS?

CORS is a browser-based security mechanism that allows servers to specify who can access their resources. It prevents web pages from making requests to a different domain, unless that domain explicitly allows it. CORS is enforced by web browsers to protect users from unauthorized cross-origin requests.

## Where is CORS Handled?

CORS is handled both on the client-side (browser) and the server-side. Let's explore each side in detail:

### Client-Side Handling

On the client-side, CORS is handled by the web browser. When a web page makes a cross-origin request (e.g., an AJAX request), the browser first checks if the server allows the request by sending a preflight request. The browser examines the response headers from the server to determine if the actual request should be allowed or blocked.

### Server-Side Handling

On the server-side, CORS is handled by the server hosting the API or web service. The server is responsible for examining the incoming requests, checking the origin of the request, and responding with appropriate CORS headers. The server can allow or deny requests based on the origin and other specified criteria.

## CORS Headers

CORS involves several headers that are used to control and secure cross-origin requests. Let's discuss the important headers:

### Origin

The `Origin` header is sent by the browser in every cross-origin request, indicating the origin (domain, scheme, and port) of the requesting web page.

### Access-Control-Allow-Origin

The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is sent by the server in the response to indicate which origins are allowed to access the server's resources. It specifies either a specific origin or the wildcard `*` to allow all origins.

### Access-Control-Allow-Methods

The `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` header specifies the HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT) allowed for the requested resource. It helps restrict unauthorized methods from being used.

### Access-Control-Allow-Headers

The `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` header lists the allowed headers in a preflight request. It ensures that only specified headers are accepted by the server.

### Access-Control-Allow-Credentials

The `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header indicates whether the response to the request can include credentials (e.g., cookies, HTTP authentication).

### Access-Control-Max-Age

The `Access-Control-Max-Age` header specifies the maximum time (in seconds) that the preflight response can be cached by the browser. It reduces the number of preflight requests.

### Access-Control-Expose-Headers

The `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` header lists the custom headers exposed by the server in the response. It allows the browser to access the specified headers in the client-side JavaScript.

## CORS Handling Examples

### Client-Side Example (JavaScript with Fetch API)

```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
        'Origin': 'https://www.mywebsite.com'
    }
})
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        // Process the received data
    })
    .catch(error

 => {
        // Handle the error
    });
```

### Server-Side Example (Spring Boot with Java)

```java
@RestController
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/data")
    public ResponseEntity<String> getData(@RequestHeader("Origin") String origin) {
        // Check origin and respond with appropriate CORS headers
        HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
        headers.setAccessControlAllowOrigin("https://www.mywebsite.com");
        headers.setAccessControlAllowMethods(Arrays.asList("GET", "POST"));
        headers.setAccessControlMaxAge(3600);
        // ... set other CORS headers
        return ResponseEntity.ok().headers(headers).body("Data response");
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

CORS plays a crucial role in securing cross-origin requests in client-server applications. It is handled both on the client-side (browser) and the server-side to ensure secure communication. Understanding and properly configuring CORS headers is essential to avoid cross-origin security vulnerabilities.

In this post, we discussed what CORS is, where it is handled, and explained the various headers involved. We also provided examples of client-side and server-side implementations using JavaScript (Fetch API) and Spring Boot (Java). By effectively handling CORS, you can enhance the security of your client-server applications.

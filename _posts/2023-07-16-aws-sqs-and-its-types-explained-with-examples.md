AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables decoupling of components in distributed systems. It provides reliable and scalable messaging capabilities, ensuring the reliable delivery of messages between various software components or microservices. In this post, we will explore the types of SQS and provide examples to illustrate their usage.

## Standard Queue

The standard queue is the default type of SQS and provides best-effort ordering of messages. It offers a high throughput and is designed to handle a large number of messages with high scalability. However, the order of message delivery is not guaranteed, and messages may be delivered multiple times. It is suitable for use cases where the order of messages is not critical, such as event-driven architectures or work queues.

## FIFO Queue

FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues guarantee the order of message delivery. Each message in a FIFO queue is assigned a unique message group ID, and messages within the same group are processed in the order they arrive. FIFO queues ensure exactly-once processing, meaning that each message is processed only once and duplicates are not introduced. They are ideal for use cases where strict ordering and deduplication of messages are required, such as financial transactions or sensitive data processing.

### Example: Sending Messages to a FIFO Queue

Here is an example of sending a message to a FIFO queue using the AWS SDK:

```java
import software.amazon.awssdk.services.sqs.SqsClient;
import software.amazon.awssdk.services.sqs.model.SendMessageRequest;

public class SQSExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SqsClient sqsClient = SqsClient.create();

        String queueUrl = "https://sqs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/123456789012/my-fifo-queue.fifo";
        String messageBody = "Hello, FIFO Queue!";

        SendMessageRequest sendMessageRequest = SendMessageRequest.builder()
                .queueUrl(queueUrl)
                .messageBody(messageBody)
                .messageGroupId("group1")  // Set the message group ID
                .build();

        sqsClient.sendMessage(sendMessageRequest);

        System.out.println("Message sent to FIFO queue.");
    }
}
```

In this example, we create an instance of the `SqsClient` and specify the URL of the FIFO queue, the message body, and the message group ID. We use the `sendMessage` method to send the message to the FIFO queue, ensuring strict ordering and deduplication.

## Conclusion

AWS SQS provides two types of queues, standard and FIFO, each catering to different messaging requirements. The standard queue offers high throughput and best-effort ordering, while the FIFO queue guarantees strict ordering and deduplication. By understanding the types of SQS and their usage scenarios, developers can effectively utilize SQS in their applications. The provided examples demonstrate how to send messages to both standard and FIFO queues using the AWS SDK. Incorporating SQS into your architecture allows for scalable, reliable, and decoupled messaging in the AWS cloud.

Functional Java and Reactive Java (also known as Reactive Programming) are two different paradigms within the Java programming language. While there can be some overlap in their concepts and techniques, they have distinct focuses and goals. Let's explore the differences between Functional Java and Reactive Java:

### Functional Java

1. **Paradigm**: Functional Java emphasizes writing code using functional programming principles, such as immutability, pure functions, higher-order functions, and function composition.
2. **Data Transformation**: It focuses on transforming data through a series of pure functions, typically using operations like mapping, filtering, and reducing.
3. **Statelessness**: Functional Java promotes immutability and avoids mutable state, making it easier to reason about code and avoid side effects.
4. **Core Constructs**: Key constructs in functional Java include lambda expressions, functional interfaces, streams, and immutable data structures.
5. **Concurrency**: Functional Java provides features like parallel streams to leverage multi-core processors and improve performance in data processing scenarios.
6. **Libraries**: Libraries like Vavr (formerly known as Javaslang) provide additional functional programming capabilities in Java.

### Reactive Java

1. **Paradigm**: Reactive Java focuses on developing applications using reactive programming principles. It aims to build systems that can react and respond to a high volume of events, requests, or data streams.
2. **Event-Driven**: Reactive Java emphasizes asynchronous and event-driven programming. It deals with streams of events and data and provides mechanisms to handle and process them efficiently.
3. **Reactive Streams**: Reactive Java often relies on the Reactive Streams specification, which provides a common API for handling asynchronous stream processing with backpressure.
4. **Non-Blocking**: Reactive Java promotes non-blocking I/O operations and uses techniques like event loops and callbacks to achieve high scalability and responsiveness.
5. **Error Handling**: Reactive Java incorporates error handling mechanisms, such as reactive error handling operators, to handle and propagate errors within the reactive flow.
6. **Libraries**: Popular libraries in Reactive Java include Project Reactor, RxJava, and Akka, which provide reactive programming abstractions and utilities.

In summary, while Functional Java focuses on writing code using functional programming principles to transform data and achieve code simplicity and modularity, Reactive Java revolves around building reactive systems that can handle high volumes of events and data streams with asynchronous and non-blocking programming techniques. Both paradigms have their strengths and use cases, and they can complement each other in certain scenarios.

## Docker Command

```shell
docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 postgres
```

```shell
The files belonging to this database system will be owned by user "postgres".
This user must also own the server process.

The database cluster will be initialized with locale "en_US.utf8".
The default database encoding has accordingly been set to "UTF8".
The default text search configuration will be set to "english".

Data page checksums are disabled.

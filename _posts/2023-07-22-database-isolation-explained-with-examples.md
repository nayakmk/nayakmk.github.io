Isolation is one of the fundamental properties of database transactions, ensuring that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. In this post, we will explore the concept of database isolation, its importance, and how it works with examples.

## Understanding Database Isolation

Database isolation refers to the property that ensures each transaction's changes are isolated from other concurrent transactions until the transaction is complete. This means that a transaction's changes are not visible to other transactions until the transaction is committed, and other transactions' changes are not visible to it until they are committed as well.

## Example: Isolation Levels

Most databases provide different isolation levels to control the visibility of changes between transactions. Let's consider the four standard isolation levels defined by the ANSI/ISO SQL standard:

1. **Read Uncommitted**: In this isolation level, a transaction can read uncommitted changes made by other transactions. This allows for the highest concurrency but may result in dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.

2. **Read Committed**: In this isolation level, a transaction can only read committed changes made by other transactions. This prevents dirty reads but may still result in non-repeatable reads and phantom reads.

3. **Repeatable Read**: In this isolation level, a transaction can read committed changes made by other transactions and ensures that any read operation within the transaction will always retrieve the same data. This prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads but may still result in phantom reads.

4. **Serializable**: In this isolation level, a transaction is completely isolated from other transactions. It ensures that no other transaction can read, write, or modify data that is being accessed by the transaction. This provides the highest level of isolation but may result in reduced concurrency.

## Example: Using Isolation Levels

Let's illustrate the different isolation levels with an example using a simple bank transaction scenario. Consider two transactions:

**Transaction A (Transfer):**
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 'A';
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 'B';
COMMIT;
```

**Transaction B (Balance Check):**
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE account_id = 'A';
COMMIT;
```

1. **Read Uncommitted**: If both transactions are running at this isolation level, Transaction B can read the uncommitted changes made by Transaction A, potentially resulting in incorrect balance information.

2. **Read Committed**: Transaction B can only read the committed changes made by Transaction A. If Transaction A has not yet committed, Transaction B will have to wait until it is committed.

3. **Repeatable Read**: Transaction B can read the committed changes made by Transaction A, and any subsequent reads within Transaction B will always retrieve the same data, regardless of any changes made by other transactions.

4. **Serializable**: Transaction B is entirely isolated from Transaction A, ensuring that no other transaction can read or modify the data accessed by Transaction B.

## Importance of Database Isolation

Database isolation is critical for ensuring data consistency, integrity, and correctness in multi-user database environments. By providing different isolation levels, databases offer developers the flexibility to balance the trade-off between concurrency and data correctness based on application requirements.

## Conclusion

Database isolation is a fundamental property of database transactions that ensures each transaction's changes are isolated from other concurrent transactions until the transaction is complete. Different isolation levels provide various levels of visibility and concurrency control. It is essential to choose the appropriate isolation level based on the application's requirements to ensure data consistency and integrity. In this post, we explored the concept of database isolation, discussed the standard isolation levels, and provided examples to illustrate their behavior. Understanding database isolation is crucial for building robust and reliable database applications.

Reactive programming provides powerful operators to control the flow of data in reactive Java applications. One such operator is `limitRate`, which allows you to limit the rate at which data is processed. In this post, we will explore various examples of using `limitRate` in reactive Java to demonstrate its versatility and usefulness.

## Example 1: Limiting the Rate of Data Processing

Let's start with a simple example where we want to limit the rate of data processing to 100 events per second. Assume we have a reactive stream of `Event` objects. Here's how we can achieve the desired rate using `limitRate`:

```java
Flux<Event> eventStream = ... // Your event stream

Flux<Event> limitedStream = eventStream.limitRate(100, Duration.ofMillis(10));

limitedStream.subscribe(event -> {
    // Process the event
});
```

In this example, we use `limitRate(100, Duration.ofMillis(10))` to limit the stream to 100 events per second (10 milliseconds between emissions). The events will be processed at the specified rate within each second.

## Example 2: Dynamic Rate Limiting

Sometimes, you may want to dynamically adjust the rate limit based on certain conditions. Let's consider an example where we have a reactive stream of `SensorData` objects, and we want to limit the rate based on the value of a sensor. Here's how we can implement dynamic rate limiting using `limitRate`:

```java
Flux<SensorData> sensorDataStream = ... // Your sensor data stream

Flux<SensorData> limitedStream = sensorDataStream.limitRate(sensorData -> {
    if (sensorData.getValue() > 50) {
        return 10; // Limit to 10 events per second for high sensor values
    } else {
        return 100; // Limit to 100 events per second for normal sensor values
    }
}, Duration.ofMillis(10));

limitedStream.subscribe(sensorData -> {
    // Process the sensor data
});
```

In this example, we use a lambda function `sensorData -> { ... }` to dynamically determine the rate limit based on the sensor data value. If the sensor value is greater than 50, we limit the stream to 10 events per second. Otherwise, we limit it to 100 events per second.

## Example 3: Combining Operators with `limitRate`

Reactive programming allows you to combine multiple operators to create complex data processing pipelines. Let's consider an example where we want to apply additional transformations to the limited stream of events. Here's how we can combine `limitRate` with other operators:

```java
Flux<Event> eventStream = ... // Your event stream

Flux<String> processedStream = eventStream
    .limitRate(50, Duration.ofMillis(20))
    .filter(event -> event.getType().equals("important"))
    .map(Event::getData);

processedStream.subscribe(data -> {
    // Process the transformed event data
});
```

In this example, we first apply `limitRate` to limit the stream to 50 events per second with a 20-millisecond interval. We then use the `filter` operator to keep only the events of type "important". Finally, we apply the `map` operator to extract the data from the events. The resulting stream contains only the transformed data from the limited and filtered events.

## Conclusion

In this post, we explored various examples of using the `limitRate` operator in reactive Java. We learned how to limit the rate of data processing, implement dynamic rate limiting based on conditions, and combine `limitRate` with other operators to create complex data processing pipelines.

By leveraging the versatility of `limitRate` and other reactive operators, you can efficiently control the flow of data in your reactive Java applications and handle different rate limiting scenarios with ease.

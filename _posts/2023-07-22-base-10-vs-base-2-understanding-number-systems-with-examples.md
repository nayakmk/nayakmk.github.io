In mathematics and computer science, numbers can be represented using different number systems. Two common number systems are Base 10 (decimal) and Base 2 (binary). In this post, we will explore the differences between these number systems and provide examples to understand how they work.

## Base 10 (Decimal)

Base 10, also known as the decimal system, is the number system we use in our everyday life. It consists of ten digits from 0 to 9. Each position in a base 10 number represents a power of 10.

**Example:**

The number "365" in base 10 can be expanded as follows:

```
365 = (3 * 10^2) + (6 * 10^1) + (5 * 10^0)
```

## Base 2 (Binary)

Base 2, also known as the binary system, is commonly used in computer science and digital electronics. It consists of only two digits, 0 and 1. Each position in a base 2 number represents a power of 2.

**Example:**

The number "101" in base 2 can be expanded as follows:

```
101 = (1 * 2^2) + (0 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0)
```

## Converting between Base 10 and Base 2

Converting a number from base 10 to base 2 and vice versa involves using the positional value of digits.

**Example:**

Converting the base 10 number "13" to base 2:

```
13 (Base 10) = 1101 (Base 2)
```

Converting the base 2 number "1010" to base 10:

```
1010 (Base 2) = (1 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (0 * 2^0) = 10 (Base 10)
```

## Why Base 2 is Used in Computers?

Base 2 is used in computers because digital electronics are based on binary logic, where signals can only have two states: 0 or 1. This simplicity allows for easy and efficient representation of data in computer memory and logic circuits.

## Conclusion

Base 10 and Base 2 are two fundamental number systems used in mathematics and computer science. Base 10 is widely used in everyday life, while Base 2 is prevalent in computer systems. Understanding these number systems and how to convert between them is essential for working with digital data and programming.

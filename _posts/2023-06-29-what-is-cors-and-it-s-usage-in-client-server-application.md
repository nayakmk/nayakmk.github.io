**What is CORS and where is it handled in a client-server application?**

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows web browsers to make secure cross-origin requests. It is an important security feature implemented by web browsers to protect users from malicious cross-origin requests.

In a client-server application, CORS is handled on the server-side. When a client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server, the server needs to determine whether it should allow the request based on the origin of the request. The origin is the combination of the protocol, domain, and port from which the request originated.

To handle CORS, the server includes a set of headers in its response that informs the browser whether the request is allowed or not. These headers provide the necessary information for the browser to enforce the security restrictions. Here are some commonly used CORS headers:

1. **Access-Control-Allow-Origin:** This header specifies the allowed origins that can access the server's resources. It can be set to a specific origin (e.g., `https://example.com`) or `*` to allow access from any origin. The server can also include multiple origins separated by commas.

2. **Access-Control-Allow-Methods:** This header specifies the allowed HTTP methods for the request. It informs the browser which methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are allowed for the particular resource.

3. **Access-Control-Allow-Headers:** This header specifies the allowed headers in the request. It informs the browser which additional headers, apart from the simple ones like `Content-Type` and `Accept`, are allowed for the particular resource.

4. **Access-Control-Allow-Credentials:** This header indicates whether the browser should include credentials (e.g., cookies, HTTP authentication) in the cross-origin request. It can be set to `true` or `false`.

5. **Access-Control-Max-Age:** This header specifies the maximum time (in seconds) that the browser should cache the CORS response. It helps in reducing the number of preflight requests made by the browser.

The server is responsible for handling CORS and including the appropriate CORS headers in its responses. The server needs to inspect the `Origin` header sent by the client and determine whether to allow or reject the request based on the CORS policy.

In most server-side frameworks, CORS handling can be done through middleware or filters. The exact implementation may vary depending on the framework and language you are using. Typically, you need to configure the allowed origins, methods, headers, and other CORS-related settings in your server-side code.

It's important to note that CORS is enforced by the browser and cannot be bypassed by client-side code alone. The server must explicitly allow cross-origin requests by including the appropriate CORS headers in its responses.

CORS plays a crucial role in ensuring the security of client-server applications and protecting users from unauthorized access to their data. By properly configuring CORS on the server-side, you can enable controlled access to your resources from different origins while maintaining the necessary security measures.

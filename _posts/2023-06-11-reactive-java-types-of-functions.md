## Types of Functions

In Reactive Java, the types of functions are similar to those in functional Java, but they often have specific names and purposes within the reactive programming paradigm. Here are some common types of functions used in Reactive Java:

### `Function<T, R>`

This functional interface represents a function that takes an argument of type `T` and returns a result of type `R`. It is used for transforming data and performing operations on individual elements in a reactive stream.

### `Consumer<T>`

The `Consumer` functional interface represents a function that takes an argument of type `T` and performs some action but does not return any result. In Reactive Java, it is commonly used for subscribing to and processing elements emitted by a reactive stream.

### `Supplier<T>`

The `Supplier` functional interface represents a function that does not take any arguments but produces a result of type `T`. It is often used in Reactive Java to provide values on demand, such as generating new elements or initializing resources.

### `BiFunction<T, U, R>`

This functional interface represents a function that takes two arguments of types `T` and `U` and returns a result of type `R`. It is used for operations that involve combining or transforming elements from multiple reactive streams.

### `Predicate<T>`

The `Predicate` functional interface represents a function that takes an argument of type `T` and returns a boolean value. In Reactive Java, it is used for filtering elements emitted by a reactive stream based on certain conditions.

### `Function<Throwable, Publisher<V>>`

This functional interface represents a function that takes an argument of type `Throwable` and returns a reactive stream represented by a `Publisher` of type `V`. It is commonly used for error handling and recovery scenarios in Reactive Java.

### `UnaryOperator<T>`

The `UnaryOperator` functional interface represents a function that takes an argument of type `T` and returns a result of the same type `T`. It is used for transformations and computations on individual elements within a reactive stream.

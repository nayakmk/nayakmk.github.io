SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an XML-based framework for exchanging authentication and authorization data between identity providers (IdPs) and service providers (SPs). In this post, we will explore how SAML works and its key components.

## Key Components of SAML

SAML involves the interaction between three main entities:

1. **Identity Provider (IdP)**: The IdP is responsible for authenticating users and issuing SAML assertions. It acts as the trusted source of authentication.

2. **Service Provider (SP)**: The SP is the application or service that users want to access. It relies on the IdP to authenticate users and receive SAML assertions.

3. **User**: The user is the entity trying to access the service provided by the SP. They authenticate with the IdP and receive SAML assertions that are used for authorization.

## SAML Workflow

The SAML workflow typically involves the following steps:

1. **User Authentication**: The user initiates the login process by accessing the SP. The SP sends an authentication request to the IdP.

2. **Identity Provider Authentication**: The IdP authenticates the user using their chosen authentication method (e.g., username and password, multi-factor authentication).

3. **SAML Assertion Generation**: After successful authentication, the IdP generates a SAML assertion containing information about the user's identity and attributes.

4. **SAML Assertion Delivery**: The IdP sends the SAML assertion to the user's browser via a POST response.

5. **SAML Assertion Exchange**: The user's browser redirects back to the SP, along with the received SAML assertion.

6. **SAML Assertion Validation**: The SP validates the SAML assertion by verifying its signature and ensuring it comes from a trusted IdP.

7. **User Authorization**: Based on the information in the SAML assertion, the SP determines the user's authorization level and grants access to the requested resources.

## SAML Profiles

SAML supports different profiles to cater to various use cases and requirements. Some commonly used profiles include:

- **Web Browser SSO Profile**: Enables users to access multiple SPs using a single authentication event.

- **Single Logout Profile**: Allows users to log out of all participating SPs and the IdP with a single action.

- **Attribute Query Profile**: Allows an SP to request additional user attributes from the IdP.

- **Enhanced Client or Proxy (ECP) Profile**: Supports scenarios where the user agent is not a web browser.

- **Identity Provider Discovery Profile**: Helps users discover the appropriate IdP based on their organization or domain.

## Conclusion

SAML provides a standardized approach for secure authentication and authorization across systems and organizations. Understanding how SAML works and its key components is crucial for implementing SAML-based single sign-on and secure user access to various services.

### Installation

In order to view the traces in Datadog, you can create a trial account by visiting `https://app.datadoghq.eu/help/quick_start`. Once the account is created ( Step 3 ) then you would need to choose an agent setup option. This option is mandatory before you can start using/seeing the traces in Datadog. 

For this setup, I have choosen the option of Windows Desktop for agent installation. Once installed and the agent is active, you would see your host appearing as below. ( Note: you would need key to send data to Datadog)

# Reactive Java Operators: Usage and Examples

Reactive programming in Java provides a wide range of operators to manipulate and control the flow of data in reactive streams. Understanding these operators and their usage is crucial for building efficient and responsive applications. In this post, we will explore the commonly used reactive Java operators, along with their usage and examples.

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `map` | Transforms each element in the stream based on a given function. | `stream.map(item -> transform(item))` |
| `filter` | Filters the stream by including only the elements that satisfy a given condition. | `stream.filter(item -> condition(item))` |
| `flatMap` | Transforms each element into a new stream and flattens the resulting streams into a single stream. | `stream.flatMap(item -> generateStream(item))` |
| `distinct` | Removes duplicate elements from the stream. | `stream.distinct()` |
| `take` | Takes a specified number of elements from the beginning of the stream. | `stream.take(5)` |
| `skip` | Skips a specified number of elements from the beginning of the stream. | `stream.skip(3)` |
| `reduce` | Applies a binary operator to the elements of the stream and returns a single value. | `stream.reduce((a, b) -> combine(a, b))` |
| `merge` | Merges multiple streams into a single stream. | `Flux.merge(stream1, stream2)` |
| `zip` | Combines elements from multiple streams into tuples. | `Flux.zip(stream1, stream2)` |
| `timeout` | Throws an error if no element is emitted within a specified time duration. | `stream.timeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))` |
| `buffer` | Collects elements from the stream into buffers and emits them as lists. | `stream.buffer(10)` |
| `scan` | Applies a binary operator to the elements of the stream and emits the intermediate results. | `stream.scan((acc, item) -> accumulate(acc, item))` |
| `distinctUntilChanged` | Removes consecutive duplicate elements from the stream. | `stream.distinctUntilChanged()` |
| `window` | Separates the stream into substreams of a specified size or based on a given condition. | `stream.window(5)` |
| `concat` | Concatenates multiple streams into a single stream, preserving the order. | `Flux.concat(stream1, stream2)` |
| `defaultIfEmpty` | Emits a default element if the stream is empty. | `stream.defaultIfEmpty(defaultValue)` |
| `onErrorResume` | Resumes the stream with another stream if an error occurs. | `stream.onErrorResume(error -> resumeWith(error))` |
| `retry` | Restarts the stream from the beginning if an error occurs. | `stream.retry(3)` |
| `timeout` | Throws an error if the stream does not complete within a specified time duration. | `stream.timeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))` |
| `groupBy` | Groups the elements of the stream based on a specified key. | `stream.groupBy(item -> getKey(item))` |
| `sample` | Emits the most recent element emitted by the stream within a specified time interval. | `stream.sample(Duration.ofSeconds(1))` |
| `onErrorResume` | Provides a fallback stream in case of an error. | `stream.onErrorResume(error -> fallbackStream)` |
| `onErrorReturn` | Emits a default value in case of an error. | `stream.onErrorReturn(defaultValue)` |
| `doOnNext` | Performs a side effect operation for each element in the stream. | `stream.doOnNext(item -> performSideEffect(item))` |
| `doOnError` | Performs a side effect operation when an error occurs in the stream. | `stream.doOnError(error -> handleException(error))` |
| `switchIfEmpty` | Switches to an alternate stream if the original stream is empty. | `stream.switchIfEmpty(alternateStream)` |
| `takeWhile` | Takes elements from the stream until a specified condition is met. | `stream.takeWhile(item -> item < 10)` |
| `skipWhile` | Skips elements from the stream until a specified condition is met. | `stream.skipWhile(item -> item < 5)` |
| `buffer` | Collects elements from the stream into buffers of a specified size or time span. | `stream.buffer(10)` |
| `throttleFirst` | Emits the first element in each time window and ignores the rest. | `stream.throttleFirst(Duration.ofSeconds(1))` |

## Conclusion

In this post, we explored various reactive Java operators and their usage with examples. These operators play a crucial role in reactive programming, allowing you to manipulate and control the flow of data in your reactive streams. By mastering these operators, you can build responsive and efficient reactive Java applications.
